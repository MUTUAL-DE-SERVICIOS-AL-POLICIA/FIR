## Install

Follow the generic plugin installation instructions in [the FIR wiki](https://github.com/certsocietegenerale/FIR/wiki/Plugins).

## Usage

The `fir_stats` plugin allows you to view statistics on incidents/events.

The plugin adds a "stats" menu on the top left of FIR, which contains graphs and other utilities to have a comprehensive view on past incidents/events recorded in FIR.

A GET parameter, `?date=<yyyy-mm-dd>`, can be used on all pages to change the date range for which stats should be displayed.
